# Exploring Factors of National Coke Consumption 
In this project, I explored the data set of National Coke Consumption across the globe in 19 different countries from different continents.

## Introduction
To explore the questions of what factors contribute to national coke consumption, I utilized data analysis techniques and Java to further understand this data set. I explored fundamental questions behind what causes different factos of the highest national coke conusumption per capita in each country.

### General Motivation
I choose this data set because I love drinking coca cola and I find that when I have traveled abroad there are different levels of consumption in different places that I go. For example, when I have traveled to places in Europe I felt as though more people were drinking coca cola, and I was curious to investigate this. I have always loved soda and specifically coca cola has been my favorite, and the level of consumption I felt varied from place to place, so I was enticed to continue this discovery process.

### Questions
The first question regarding the data that I attempted to answer is if there is a relationship between the proximity of where coca cola originated (Atlanta, GA in USA) and to where its the most popular.The second question that I attempted to answer is if other soft drink beverages, like sprite or fanta, have the same highest consumption rate in other countries (like if coke is highest in one country, does that mean fanta will be the highest as well). Another question that I attempted to answer is if there is a relationship between countries with the highest levels of obesity and the countries with the highest levels of consumption for coca cola.

## Methods
### Dataset Source
This data set was generated from the Beverage Digest, a privately owned company which publishes and gathers data regarding non-alcoholc beverages. This data was compiled through national survey in each of the countries. I originally found this data set on the website, University Magazine from Canada, whose goal is to provides tips on Student Life, Financial, Career, Majors, Ranking, and Important news that will impact students. To discover specifically how my data set was created, I reached out to the company. An employee from Beverage Digest explained that they use cross references and a proprietary model to collect their data. 

### Privacy and Rights to Data Set
I am able to use this dataset because on the website of the Beverage Digest under the copyright and privacy section it allows users to each download one pdf/excel document version of the data. Additioally, the data can also be found on statista, which is a free, credible, online source with hundreds of thousands of data sets.

### Process
I went about answering the questions by first gathering the data from outside sources that I would need, starting with the proximity of each of the countries to the United States of America. I did this by finding the distance in miles from the country on the original data set to the United states. I researched the average distance in miles from each of the countries in my data set to the United States of America, the country of origin of Coca Cola.

Next, I looked at the data and determined if there was any correlation between which had the lowest distance but highest consumption per capita of coca cola using statistiacal analysis and Java features. To answer the next question regarding the relationship between other beverage consumption, I selected the second most popular and nationally reaching soda, which is Pepsi. I then repeated the process of finding data on the per capita consumption of this soda and inputted it into my spreadsheet containing my other data. To answer the question regarding the relatinoship between obesity and Coca Cola consumption in each country, I collected data on the average BMI of indviduals per country, which is the most common measure of national obesity per country.

#### Utilizing Java
The first parasing that I did with the file was finding the average coca cola consumption in each of the countries, through iterating through each of the columns of the data.
 
### Challenges
One challenge that I ran into was when I was compiling data from the internet outside of my original data set from the Beverage Digest, I had to ensure that it was coming from reputable sources when I was pulling the data from Google. To go about solving this issue, I made sure to only find data coming from places with .gov or national affiliation, instead of just choosing the first statistic that I found. Another challenge that I faced was determining the overlap in data and because the sample size was relatively small, it was difficult to make meaningful conclusions.

## Results and Conclusions
In my results, I found that

Overall, the data showed that the average level of consumption of coca cola in each of the 18 countries in my data set was

### Further Research
If I had more time and resources that I would utilize to continue analyzing and understanding this data set is the distribution pathways and availability of coca cola in each of these countries. For example, I would look into the question regarding if the reason that there is higher consumption in some places over others is because of the larger accesibility to distribution networks and the amount that each is available in stores or other places.


### Bar Graph 
In order to visualize the data that I was working with, I constructed a simple bar chart to display the quantitative data of the comparison of each country with their average coca cola conusmption levels per capita for the 19 countries.

### World Graph
Additionally, I used another feature to visualize my data that displays the distributio and relative quantities of per capita consumption of coca cola across the world by country. The darker and more saturated countries represent higher per capita consumption and the lighter less saturated countries represent the lower amounts of per capita consumption.
